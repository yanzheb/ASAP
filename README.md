Code for the paper titled "ASAP: Attention-Based State Space Abstraction for Policy Summarization"

To get the results for ASAP shown in the paper, run the Jupyter notebook named "results.ipynb". The repository includes the models used in the experiments with Tensorboard log files, so you do not need to retrain yourself. They are stored in the folder named "runs." To train ASAP from scratch, use the file "cluster_importance.py." The "requirements.txt" was made later, so it does not contain identical versions of packages, but I have tested them, and they are working.

The hyperparameters used to train ASAP are stored in the folder "configs."
